This portfolio includes test cases, bug reports based on sample applications, and additional materials that reflect my knowledge and skills. I value precision and take pride in ensuring high product quality.

*** ABOUT ME ***

I decided to transition into the IT industry because I’m fascinated by the process of creating and improving software. What I particularly value in software testing is the ability to combine analytical thinking with attention to detail, and to have a real impact on the quality of the product delivered to users.

I have completed postgraduate studies in Software Testing, hold the ISTQB Certified Tester – Foundation Level certificate, and I continuously expand my knowledge through online courses and hands-on projects. I’m looking to begin my career with manual testing and gradually develop my skills in test automation as well.

In my previous professional roles, I had the opportunity to participate in exploratory testing and UAT (User Acceptance Testing), which helped me understand the verification and acceptance process from an end-user perspective. This experience has shown me how important software quality and usability are in the daily operations of an organization.

I am well-organized and able to work independently, but I also thrive in collaborative team environments. I believe that sharing knowledge and perspectives is key to solving problems effectively.

My goal is not only to develop my technical skills but also to gain valuable project experience that will allow me to support teams in delivering high-quality software.
